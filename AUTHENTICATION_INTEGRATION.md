# Authentication Integration Summary

## Overview
The authentication functionality from `_main.py` and `_requirements.txt` has been successfully integrated into the main backend (`main.py` and `requirements.txt`).

## What Was Integrated

### 1. Dependencies Added to `requirements.txt`
- `PyJWT>=2.8.0` - For JWT token handling
- `pydantic[email]>=2.5.0` - For email validation (already had pydantic, added email validation)

### 2. Authentication Models and Configuration
- **UserSignup**: Registration model with validation for fullname, email, password, sex, and date of birth
- **UserLogin**: Login model for email and password
- **Token**: Response model for authentication tokens
- **UserResponse**: User profile response model
- **Sex Enum**: Gender options (male, female, other)

### 3. Database Setup
- SQLite database (`users.db`) with users table
- Automatic database initialization on server startup
- User management functions (create, retrieve, verify)

### 4. Authentication Utilities
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token creation and validation
- User authentication and authorization

### 5. Authentication Endpoints

#### POST `/auth/signup`
Register a new user account.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "fullname": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "sex": "male",
  "dob": "1990-01-01"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "user_id": 1,
  "fullname": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

#### POST `/auth/login`
Authenticate user and get access token.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

**Response:** Same as signup response

#### GET `/auth/me`
Get current user profile (requires authentication).

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "fullname": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "sex": "male",
  "dob": "1990-01-01",
  "created_at": "2024-01-01 12:00:00"
}
```

#### GET `/auth/protected`
Example protected route (requires authentication).

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Hello John Doe, this is a protected route!",
  "user_id": 1
}
```

## Validation Rules

### User Registration Validation
- **Fullname**: Minimum 2 characters, trimmed
- **Email**: Valid email format, unique in database
- **Password**: Minimum 6 characters
- **Sex**: Must be one of: male, female, other
- **Date of Birth**: YYYY-MM-DD format, user must be 13-120 years old

### Authentication
- JWT tokens expire after 30 minutes
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Email addresses are validated for format

## Security Features
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token-based authentication
- Email uniqueness validation
- Age verification (minimum 13 years)
- Input validation and sanitization

## Usage Examples

### 1. User Registration
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/auth/signup" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fullname": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword",
    "sex": "female",
    "dob": "1995-05-15"
  }'
```

### 2. User Login
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword"
  }'
```

### 3. Get User Profile
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/auth/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### 4. Test Protected Route
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/auth/protected" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## Integration Status
âœ… **Complete**: All authentication functionality has been successfully integrated into the main backend.

## Next Steps
1. You can now safely delete `_main.py` and `_requirements.txt`
2. The authentication endpoints are available at `/auth/*`
3. All existing yoga pose analysis endpoints remain unchanged
4. The API documentation is available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## Notes
- The database file `users.db` will be created automatically when the server starts
- JWT tokens are configured with a 30-minute expiration time
- All authentication endpoints include proper error handling and validation
- The integration maintains backward compatibility with existing pose analysis functionality
